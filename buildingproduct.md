# Product

Michael's business worked because:

- We kept costs low
- We had a highly technical team
- Passionate about the product

## Ask yourself

+ How serious is your problem?
+ How specifically are you solving the problem for first?
+ Solve a problem people need to solve regularly
+ How easy are your customers to find?
+ Does your MVP actually solve the problem?

+ Get users on your product early (you are not an artist)
+ Who are the most desperate customers, sell to them first. If it takes 10 months, they aren't desperate
+ Who's business is going to go out of business, without your software?
+ Be weary of 'customers' who are taking the piss and avoid them
+ Be cautious with your discounts. Use discounts for urgency but don't devalue your product / service

## Metrics

- Super important: ensure your stats are part of the build process
- Should be a sources of ideas for features and solutions
- Google Analytics is not optimal, you need an events based analytics solution (Mixpanel...) as well
- Pick 5-6 simple stats to track, don't overload yourself
- Ensure you are tracking if people are using product or not
- Maintain a clear spec that you are building that all team members can refer to

## Dev Cycles

You need to build lots of things because you don't know what will work. So having short dev cycles and a good technical team is crucial. and getting feedback from quick, scrappy MVPs let you know what you should be building.

- Keep them short
- Have a single KPI that reflects how you are doing (Money if you charge / Usage if you don't)
- Ensure everyone in the company knows what the KPI is and was
- Brainstorm solutions (with metrics to support / destroy ideas)
  - Categorise: New Features & Optimisations / Bug Features / Tests
  - Prioritise: Easy / Medium / Hard
- Decide
  - which hard item with impact the KPI the most
  - Which Medium item...
  - Which Easy item...
- Create the spec for each item
- Distribute tasks
- Meet once a week or bi-weekly, enough time to get shit done

## Pivot or Iterate

- Give your product time be properly validated
- Pivot: Changing problem or Customer
- Iterate: Changing the solution
- Identifying the problem is the genius
- Don't be fake Steve Jobs; iterate and talk to customers
- Ask a specific customer what they want and make it (if it makes sense for your KPI)
