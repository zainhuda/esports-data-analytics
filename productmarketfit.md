Idea > Traction: Is finding Product Market Fit (Hardest Stage)

Traction > Growth: Is optimising product market fit

# Major Challenges

- Building a product that a lot of people want
- Building a great team
- Making money (Distant 3rd)

# Market Research is not going to help

- Best companies create their own market
- You are looking for a hidden need
- If it's obvious, lots of people will be doing it
- What job are people hiring you to do? (Read: Jobs to be done)
- Where are your customers pulling you?
  - You shouldn't be pushing your customers
  - Look for how users are hacking your solution to do something you haven't thought of

# Building a remarkable product

1. talk to customers and develop a market thesis
2. Listen to customer problems, not solutions
3. Rapid prototyping & user testing
4. Build solution to problem
  - People don't know what they want, that's why market research isn't ideal. But talking to customers is critical.
  - No great solution was built in vacuum
  - Most important thing is to quickly infront of users
  - Don't worry about making things that will scale
  - Product experience is more important than money
  - No matter how many times you think you will need to iterate, 10x it
    - Keep costs low
    - Build a team that can do this quickly (outsourcing might not be ideal)
5. Test solution with customers
  1. Make sure you are talking to target customer (be willing to change target customer if it makes business sense)
  2. Don't over think
  3. Run customer Interviews (10 is usually enough)
  4. UX testing sessions (3-5 is okay)
    1. Most important thing you can do
    2. Get people to use app in front of you
    3. Force them to give honest feedback
    4. Ask them to perform a task, without your input
    5. Do not say anything!!!
  5. Metrics (You will never have a large enough sample size)
6. Did it work? (Data!) if false { return 1 }

By the time you have cycled through this 27 times, you might have something. No one get's it right the first time. Don't expect to.

# Launching

- Aim for: Minimum Remarkable Product
- Launch when your product when it's better than competitors

# Prioritising

- Focus only on the thing that gets you to the next milestone, nothing else
- Prioritise for learning
  - "What is my biggest unknown, right now?"

# Achieving product market fit

- Track
  - Return usage: vital (Days: 1, 3, 30)
  - NPS
    - > 50 is probably Product Market Fit
    - It can get negative
  - Payment Renewal Rate (Not Churn. Churn can be deceptive)

  Less important metrics

  - Signups is not as important as Active Users
  - Conversion Rates aren't super important
- When you have it, people are fighting to get to your product

# Beyond Product Market Fit

## Key three things

1. Product must be meaningfully different from competitors
2. How to acquire customers in a differentiated way that scales
3. Invent a business model that doesn't kill your business model

## Scaling the team

- Don't scale team until Product Market Fit
- You will need management once you have 27+ people
- You need to know everything until you get beyond 27 people
- Once you get Product Market Fit, scale aggressively
- Build team aggressively but not excessively
- Delegate, no micromanagement  beyond 27 people

## Branding

- Great brands are built around a consumer insight
- Don't over think this

- "Your company only fails when you give up"
